This KiCAD project is an 1 MHz bus interface for the Acorn Atom and Acorn System series computers. It provides both 1 MHz bus and BBC Micro compatible User Port. The 6522 
of the Atom or System CPU board is used for the User Port interface. The AB connector is placed on the board in a way that you can easily swap both rows. It might be necessary 
to shorten the board to the printed line at the solder side, next to the AB connector.
